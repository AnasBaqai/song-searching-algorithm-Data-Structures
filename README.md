# Song Searching Algorithm with AVL Trees

The Song Searching Algorithm with AVL Trees is a data structure implementation in C++ that allows for efficient searching and retrieval of songs based on various criteria. It utilizes the AVL tree data structure to store and organize the songs, enabling fast and balanced searching operations. The system provides functionality for searching songs, recommending the top 5 songs based on user preferences, and generating 5 random songs.

## Features

- **Song Searching:** Users can search for songs by title, artist, genre, or any other specified criteria. The algorithm efficiently locates the songs matching the search criteria and returns the results.

- **Top 5 Song Recommendations:** The system provides recommendations for the top 5 songs based on user preferences. This feature uses the AVL tree's sorting capabilities to identify and suggest the most relevant songs.

- **Random Song Generation:** Users can generate a list of 5 random songs from the song database. This feature ensures a diverse and unexpected selection of songs for users to explore.

## Technologies Used

- C++: Programming language used for implementing the song searching algorithm and data structures.
- AVL Trees: Self-balancing binary search tree data structure used for efficient searching and retrieval of songs.
